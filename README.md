# Cleaning_Data

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5.From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

#OUTPUT

1.Open the R script run_analysis.r using a text editor.
2.Change the parameter of the setwd function call to the working directory/folder (i.e., the folder where these the R script file is saved).
3. Run the R script run_analysis.r 

#Outputs produced

1. Tidy dataset file tidydata.txt (tab-delimited text)
2. Codebook file CodeBook.md (Markdown)
